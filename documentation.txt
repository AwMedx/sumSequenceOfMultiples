Sequence:
  (n*1) + (n*2) + ...

Formula Function:
  Return the sum of the sequence of multiples of n

Variables:
  n: base number ('multiple of 4'; n is the 4 in this case)
  m: # that is being multipled to n
  M = # of m
  
Formula:
  Sum of (n*1) + (n*2) + ... = n/2 * M(M+1)

Example:
  n: 4
  
  4+8+12+16 = 40
  m: 4

  4/2 * 4(4+1) = 
  2 * 20 =
  40
